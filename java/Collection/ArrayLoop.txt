Java provides several types of collection classes in the java.util package, including:

    ArrayList: An array-based implementation of the List interface that dynamically resizes as elements are added or removed.

    LinkedList: A linked-list implementation of the List interface that allows for efficient insertion and removal of elements at the beginning and end of the list.

    HashSet: A set implementation that uses a hash table for storage and does not allow duplicate elements.

    TreeSet: A set implementation that uses a balanced tree for storage and does not allow duplicate elements. It sorts the elements in natural order.

    HashMap: A map implementation that uses a hash table for storage and allows one key-value pair per key.

    TreeMap: A map implementation that uses a balanced tree for storage and allows one key-value pair per key. It sorts the keys in natural order.

    Vector: A dynamic array implementation of the List interface that is similar to ArrayList, but is synchronized.

    Stack: A last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure implemented as an extension of the Vector class.

    Queue: A first-in, first-out (FIFO) data structure implemented by several classes such as LinkedList, PriorityQueue, and ArrayDeque.

    Deque: A double-ended queue data structure implemented by several classes such as LinkedList, ArrayDeque.

These are the commonly used collection classes, but there are many more which are specialized for different use cases.
