create a list of integer using constructor

Here's an example of creating a list of integers using the constructor in Java:

import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<Integer> intList = new ArrayList<Integer>(5);
        intList.add(1);
        intList.add(2);
        intList.add(3);
        intList.add(4);
        intList.add(5);

        // Iterating through the list
        for (Integer i : intList) {
            System.out.println(i);
        }
    }
}

In this example, we are creating an ArrayList of Integers using the constructor that takes an initial capacity of 5. We are adding 5 integers to the list using the add() method and then printing out the contents of the list using an enhanced for loop.

Alternatively you can use following constructor to create List of integers

List<Integer> intList = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5));

This will also create a list of integers.

what other type in java collection

Java provides several types of collection classes in the java.util package, including:

    ArrayList: An array-based implementation of the List interface that dynamically resizes as elements are added or removed.

    LinkedList: A linked-list implementation of the List interface that allows for efficient insertion and removal of elements at the beginning and end of the list.

    HashSet: A set implementation that uses a hash table for storage and does not allow duplicate elements.

    TreeSet: A set implementation that uses a balanced tree for storage and does not allow duplicate elements. It sorts the elements in natural order.

    HashMap: A map implementation that uses a hash table for storage and allows one key-value pair per key.

    TreeMap: A map implementation that uses a balanced tree for storage and allows one key-value pair per key. It sorts the keys in natural order.

    Vector: A dynamic array implementation of the List interface that is similar to ArrayList, but is synchronized.

    Stack: A last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure implemented as an extension of the Vector class.

    Queue: A first-in, first-out (FIFO) data structure implemented by several classes such as LinkedList, PriorityQueue, and ArrayDeque.

    Deque: A double-ended queue data structure implemented by several classes such as LinkedList, ArrayDeque.

These are the commonly used collection classes, but there are many more which are specialized for different use cases.

how can I linkedList

A LinkedList in Java is a collection that implements the List interface and is based on a doubly-linked list data structure. It allows for efficient insertion and removal of elements at the beginning and end of the list, as well as efficient access to elements in the middle of the list.

Here is an example of creating and using a LinkedList:

import java.util.LinkedList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LinkedList<String> list = new LinkedList<>();
        list.add("Apple");
        list.add("Banana");
        list.add("Cherry");
        System.out.println(list);

        list.addFirst("Strawberry");
        System.out.println(list);

        list.addLast("Peach");
        System.out.println(list);

        list.removeFirst();
        System.out.println(list);

        list.removeLast();
        System.out.println(list);
    }
}

In this example, we are creating a LinkedList of strings and adding elements to it using the add() method. We are also using the addFirst() and addLast() methods to insert elements at the beginning and end of the list, respectively. We are also using the removeFirst() and removeLast() methods to remove elements from the beginning and end of the list.

You can also use getFirst() and getLast() method to get the first and last element from the list respectively.

You can also use add(index, element) method to add element at specific index.

You can use remove(index) method to remove element from specific index.

You can use get(index) method to get element from specific index.

You can use size() method to get the size of the LinkedList.

You can use contains(element) method to check whether the element is present or not in the list.

How to create HashSet

A HashSet in Java is a collection that implements the Set interface and is based on a hash table data structure. It does not allow duplicate elements, and provides constant-time performance for the basic operations such as adding, removing, and checking for the presence of an element.

Here is an example of creating and using a HashSet:

import java.util.HashSet;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HashSet<String> set = new HashSet<>();
        set.add("Apple");
        set.add("Banana");
        set.add("Cherry");
        set.add("Apple"); // This will not be added to the set as it is already present
        System.out.println(set); // Prints [Apple, Banana, Cherry]

        set.remove("Banana");
        System.out.println(set); // Prints [Apple, Cherry]

        System.out.println(set.contains("Apple")); // Prints true
        System.out.println(set.size()); // Prints 2
    }
}

In this example, we are creating a HashSet of strings and adding elements to it using the add() method. We are also removing an element from the set using the remove() method and checking if an element is present in the set using the contains() method. we are also using size() method to get the size of the set.

You can also create a HashSet using the constructor that takes an initial capacity and a load factor as arguments:

HashSet<String> set = new HashSet<>(16, 0.75f);

The initial capacity is the number of buckets in the hash table, and the load factor is a threshold that controls when the hash table should be resized to accommodate more elements.

You can also create a HashSet by passing a collection to the constructor:

List<String> list = Arrays.asList("Apple", "Banana", "Cherry");
HashSet<String> set = new HashSet<>(list);

You can also use isEmpty() method to check whether the set is empty or not.

You can use clear() method to remove all the elements from the set.

You can use iterator() method to get the iterator for the set.

You can use toArray() method to get the array of elements in the set.

TreeSet

A TreeSet in Java is a collection that implements the SortedSet interface and is based on a balanced tree data structure. It does not allow duplicate elements, and provides logarithmic-time performance for the basic operations such as adding, removing, and checking for the presence of an element. The elements in a TreeSet are sorted according to their natural order or according to a specified comparator.

Here is an example of creating and using a TreeSet:

import java.util.TreeSet;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TreeSet<String> set = new TreeSet<>();
        set.add("Apple");
        set.add("Banana");
        set.add("Cherry");
        System.out.println(set); // Prints [Apple, Banana, Cherry] in ascending order

        set.remove("Banana");
        System.out.println(set); // Prints [Apple, Cherry]

        System.out.println(set.contains("Apple")); // Prints true
        System.out.println(set.size()); // Prints 2
    }
}

In this example, we are creating a TreeSet of strings and adding elements to it using the add() method. The elements are stored in the set in ascending order, based on their natural order. We are also removing an element from the set using the remove() method and checking if an element is present in the set using the contains() method. we are also using size() method to get the size of the set.

You can also create a TreeSet using a comparator:

import java.util.Comparator;
import java.util.TreeSet;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TreeSet<String> set = new TreeSet<>(new LengthComparator());
        set.add("Apple");
        set.add("Banana");
        set.add("Cherry");
        System.out.println(set); // Prints [Apple, Cherry, Banana] based on the length of the string
    }

    static class LengthComparator implements Comparator<String> {
        @Override
        public int

Sakalans Now
HashMap

A HashMap in Java is a collection that implements the Map interface and is based on a hash table data structure. It is used to store key-value pairs, where each key is unique, and allows for efficient insertion, removal, and retrieval of values based on their associated keys.

Here is an example of creating and using a HashMap:

import java.util.HashMap;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        map.put("Apple", 1);
        map.put("Banana", 2);
        map.put("Cherry", 3);
        System.out.println(map); // Prints {Apple=1, Banana=2, Cherry=3}

        System.out.println(map.get("Apple")); // Prints 1
        System.out.println(map.containsKey("Banana")); // Prints true
        System.out.println(map.size()); // Prints 3

        map.remove("Banana");
        System.out.println(map); // Prints {Apple=1, Cherry=3}
    }
}

In this example, we are creating a HashMap that maps strings (the keys) to integers (the values) and adding key-value pairs to it using the put() method. We are also retrieving the value associated with a key

show methods

Here are some of the commonly used methods in HashMap:

    put(K key, V value): Associates the specified value with the specified key in this map. If the map previously contained a mapping for the key, the old value is replaced by the specified value.

    get(Object key): Returns the value to which the specified key is mapped, or null if this map contains no mapping for the key.

    containsKey(Object key): Returns true if this map contains a mapping for the specified key.

    remove(Object key): Removes the mapping for the specified key from this map if present.

    size(): Returns the number of key-value mappings in this map.

    isEmpty(): Returns true if this map contains no key-value mappings.

    clear(): Removes all of the mappings from this map.

    keySet(): Returns a Set view of the keys contained in this map.

    values(): Returns a Collection view of the values contained in this map.

    entrySet(): Returns a Set view of the mappings contained in this map.

    putAll(Map<? extends K,? extends V> m): Copies all of the mappings from the specified map to this map.

    getOrDefault(Object key, V defaultValue): Returns the value to which the specified key is mapped, or the defaultValue if this map contains no mapping for the key.

    replace(K key, V value): Replaces the entry for the specified key only if it is currently mapped to some value.

    replace(K key, V oldValue, V newValue): Replaces the entry for the specified key only if currently mapped to the specified value.

    computeIfAbsent(K key, Function<? super K,? extends V> mappingFunction): If the specified key is not already associated with a value (or is mapped to null) associates it with

I apologize, it looks like I cut off the end of my previous response. To complete my explanation, the computeIfAbsent() method computes a value using the given function, if the key is not already associated with a value, or returns the current value if it is.

And computeIfPresent(K key, BiFunction<? super K,? super V,? extends V> remappingFunction) If the value for the specified key is present and non-null, attempts to compute a new mapping given the key and its current mapped value.

and compute(K key, BiFunction<? super K,? super V,? extends V> remappingFunction) Attempts to compute a mapping for the specified key and its current mapped value (or null if there is no current mapping).

and merge(K key, V value, BiFunction<? super V,? super V,? extends V> remappingFunction) If the specified key is not already associated with a value or is associated with null, associates it with the given non-null value.


Vector

A Vector in Java is a collection that implements the List interface and is similar to an ArrayList. It is backed by an array data structure and provides similar methods for adding, removing, and accessing elements, but it is synchronized, meaning that multiple threads can access it without causing conflicts. This makes it useful in situations where multiple threads may need to access the collection at the same time.

Here is an example of creating and using a Vector:

import java.util.Vector;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vector<String> vector = new Vector<>();
        vector.add("Apple");
        vector.add("Banana");
        vector.add("Cherry");
        System.out.println(vector); // Prints [Apple, Banana, Cherry]

        vector.remove("Banana");
        System.out.println(vector); // Prints [Apple, Cherry]

        System.out.println(vector.get(0)); // Prints Apple
        System.out.println(vector.size()); // Prints 2
    }
}

In this example, we are creating a Vector of strings and adding elements to it using the add() method. We are also removing an element from the vector using the remove() method and accessing an element at a specific index using the `get()

    lastIndexOf(Object o): Returns the index of the last occurrence of the specified element in this Vector, or -1 if this Vector does not contain the element.

    toArray(): Returns an array containing all of the elements in this Vector in the correct order.

    subList(int fromIndex, int toIndex): Returns a view of the portion of this Vector between the specified fromIndex, inclusive, and toIndex, exclusive.

    trimToSize(): Trims the capacity of this Vector to be the Vector's current size.

    ensureCapacity(int minCapacity): Increases the capacity of this Vector, if necessary, to ensure that it can hold at least the number of elements specified by the minimum capacity argument

    stack

A stack is a data structure that stores a collection of items in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) order. This means that the last item added to the stack will be the first item to be removed. Stacks are often used in computer programming for tasks such as memory management and undo/redo functionality. Some common operations on a stack include push (adding an item to the top of the stack), pop (removing an item from the top of the stack), and peek (viewing the top item on the stack without removing it).
Sakalans Now
stack in java

In Java, a stack can be implemented using the Stack class, which is part of the Java Collection Framework. The Stack class extends the Vector class and provides a standard implementation of the last-in, first-out (LIFO) stack data structure.

Here is an example of how to use the Stack class in Java:

import java.util.Stack;

public class StackExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<Integer>();

        //adding elements to the stack
        stack.push(1);
        stack.push(2);
        stack.push(3);

        System.out.println("Elements in stack: " + stack);
        //Elements in stack: [1, 2, 3]

        //removing elements from the stack
        int removedItem = stack.pop();
        System.out.println("Removed item: " + removedItem);
        //Removed item: 3
        System.out.println("Elements in stack: " + stack);
        //Elements in stack: [1, 2]

        //checking the element at the top of the stack
        int top = stack.peek();
        System.out.println("Top element: " + top);
        //Top element: 2
    }
}

Note that the Stack class is considered as an legacy class and it is recommended to use Deque interface along with ArrayDeque class or LinkedList class for stack implementation in java.
Sakalans Now
queque

A queue is a data structure that stores a collection of items in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) order. This means that the first item added to the queue will be the first item to be removed. Queues are often used in computer programming for tasks such as scheduling and managing resources. Some common operations on a queue include enqueue (adding an item to the back of the queue), dequeue (removing an item from the front of the queue), and peek (viewing the front item on the queue without removing it).

In Java, a queue can be implemented using the Queue interface and its implementing classes such as LinkedList and PriorityQueue.

Here is an example of how to use the LinkedList class in Java to implement a queue:

import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;

public class QueueExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<Integer>();

        //adding elements to the queue
        queue.offer(1);
        queue.offer(2);
        queue.offer(3);

        System.out.println("Elements in queue: " + queue);
        //Elements in queue: [1, 2, 3]

        //removing elements from the queue
        int removedItem = queue.poll();
        System.out.println("Removed item: " + removedItem);
        //Removed item: 1
        System.out.println("Elements in queue: " + queue);
        //Elements in queue: [2, 3]

        //checking the element at the front of the queue
        int front = queue.peek();
        System.out.println("Front element: " + front);
        //Front element: 2
    }
}

Note that the Queue interface provides a more comprehensive set of operations than the basic FIFO operations, including element-based operations, bulk operations, and concurrency operations.
Sakalans Now
Deque

A Double Ended Queue (Deque) is a data structure that allows elements to be added or removed at both the front and the back of the queue. It is also known as a "double-ended queue" or "deck" and it combines the behavior of both a stack and a queue. The name "deque" is short for "double-ended queue".

In Java, a Deque can be implemented using the Deque interface and its implementing classes such as ArrayDeque and LinkedList. The Deque interface extends the Queue interface and provides additional methods for adding and removing elements from the front and the back of the deque.

Here is an example of how to use the ArrayDeque class in Java to implement a Deque:

import java.util.Deque;
import java.util.ArrayDeque;

public class DequeExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Deque<Integer> deque = new ArrayDeque<Integer>();

        //adding elements to the front of the deque
        deque.addFirst(1);
        deque.offerFirst(2);
        //adding elements to the back of the deque
        deque.addLast(3);
        deque.offerLast(4);

        System.out.println("Elements in deque: " + deque);
        //Elements in deque: [2, 1, 3, 4]

        //removing elements from the front of the deque
        int removedItem = deque.removeFirst();
        System.out.println("Removed item: " + removedItem);
        //Removed item: 2
        System.out.println("Elements in deque: " + deque);
        //Elements in deque: [1, 3, 4]

        //removing elements from the back of the deque
        int lastRemoved = deque.removeLast();
        System.out.println("Removed item from last: " + lastRemoved);
        //Removed item from last: 4
        System.out.println("Elements in deque: " + deque);
        //Elements in deque: [1, 3]

        //checking the element at the front of the deque
        int front = deque.peekFirst();
        System.out.println("Front element: " + front);
        //Front element: 1

        //checking the element at the back of the deque
        int last = deque.peekLast();
        System.out.println("Last element: " + last);
        //Last element: 3
    }
}

Deque provides a lot of useful methods, it can be used as stack and queue data structure, and it can be used in a lot of algorithms that involve adding and removing elements at both ends, such as LRU Cache, Palindrome Checker, Round Robin Scheduling, etc.
Sakalans Now
how can i see the methods

You can see the methods of a class or an interface in Java by using the javadoc command in the command line, or by using an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.

The javadoc command generates HTML documentation for a given set of Java source files. To see the documentation for a specific class or interface, you can use the following command:

javadoc <class or interface name>

For example, to see the documentation for the Deque interface, you can use the following command:

javadoc java.util.Deque

This will generate an HTML file containing the documentation for the Deque interface, including information about its package, its implemented interfaces, and its methods.

Alternatively, you can use your IDE, for example in Eclipse you can use the F3 button on a class name and it will navigate to the class and you will be able to see the methods, constructors, and fields.

In Intellij IDEA, you can use Ctrl + B on a class name and it will navigate to the class and you will be able to see the methods, constructors, and fields.

By using either of the above methods you can see all the methods that Deque interface or any class provides and also the details of each method.
