/*In JavaScript, an object is a collection of properties and methods that can be used to store and manipulate data. Objects are a fundamental part of the language and can be used to represent a wide variety of real-world entities, such as people, cars, or even entire applications.

JavaScript provides several ways to create objects, including:

    Object literals: An object can be created by using curly braces {} and defining properties and methods inside them. For example:*/

    let person = {
    name: "John",
    age: 30,
    sayHello: function() {
        console.log("Hello, my name is " + this.name);
    }
};

/*Constructor functions: An object can be created by using a constructor function, which is a function that is used to create and initialize objects. The constructor function can be defined using the function keyword, and it is typically named with a capital letter to indicate that it is a constructor. Here's an example:*/

function P(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
}
let p = new Person("John", 30);

/*Object.create() method: An object can be created by using the Object.create() method, which creates a new object with a specified prototype. Here's an example*/

let personPrototype = {
    sayHello: function() {
        console.log("Hello, my name is " + this.name);
    }
};
let personk = Object.create(personPrototype);
personk.name = "John";
personk.age = 30;

/*Once you've created an object, you can use the dot notation (.) or the square bracket notation ([]) to access its properties and methods. For example:*/

console.log(personk.name); // Output: "John"
console.log(personk["age"]); // Output: 30
person.sayHello(); // Output: "Hello, my name is John"

/*Objects in JavaScript are powerful and flexible, they can be used to represent a wide variety of data and can be nested inside other objects. They are also the foundation of many popular JavaScript frameworks and libraries, such as React and Angular.
